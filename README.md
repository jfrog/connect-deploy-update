# Deploy Device Update Action

[![ci](https://github.com/upswift/connect-deploy-update/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/upswift/connect-deploy-update/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This GitHub Action allows you to deploy a JFrog Connect Update Flow to IoT or edge devices. Specify which devices you would like to update, assign a specific deployment tag (app_name) and version (app_version) to the deployment, set the the parameters for the deployment, and add a comment. The update flow itself should be configured using the JFrog Connect web UI.

## Usage

### Example Invocation

#### Minimal

```yaml
      - uses: jfrog/connect-deploy-update@v1

          flow_uuid: d-feaf-d9aa
          token: ${{ secrets.CONNECT_API_TOKEN }}
```

                "value": "online"
              }
            ]
          flow_uuid: d-feaf-d9aa
          app_name: my_app
          app_version: 1.0.0
          comment: 'deployed using GitHub Actions!'
          parameters_mapping: >
            {
              "update_param_name1": "value",
              "update_param_name2": "value"
            }
          token: ${{ secrets.CONNECT_API_TOKEN }}
```

### Inputs

* project_key (required): The JFrog Connect fleet key where the deployment will be executed.
* groups (optional): The device group names in JSON format to filter by group. Example: ["Production", "QA"].
* filters (optional): The filters in JSON format to define device-specific criteria. Each filter includes type, operand,
  and value. See device_filter below for details.
* flow_uuid (required): The update flow UUID that specifies which flow to use. You can obtain the UUID from the “Update
  Flows” tab in the JFrog Connect web UI.
* app_name (optional): The name of the deployment tag to be deployed (must exist in the Connect web UI).
* app_version (optional): The version of the deployment tag to deploy.
* comment (optional): A brief comment to describe the purpose or details of the deployment. Default is Default comment.
* parameters_mapping (optional): The mapping of parameters for the update configuration in JSON format. Example: {"
  update_param_name1": "value", "update_param_name2": "value"}.
* token (required): The authorization token for authentication.

### API Request Structure

#### device_filter

The device_filter object defines which devices will be acted on based on the following parameters:

#### groups

* Type: Array of strings
* Description: One or multiple groups to include in the filter.
* Example: ["Production", "QA"]

#### filters

The filters array defines the criteria for the devices to be included in the deployment. You can use multiple filters
with an AND relationship. Each filter has a type, operand, and value:

* Type: Array of objects
* Description: Criteria for filtering devices.
* Example:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "specific_device",
    "operand": "is",
    "value": "d-ebcd-9114"
  },
  {
    "type": "tag",
    "operand": "is",
    "value": "stable"
  }
]
```

#### Filter Types

* **specific_device**: Filters by the specific device’s UUID. The UUID can be obtained from the Devices page in the
  Connect web UI.
  * Operands: is, is_not
  * Value: Device UUID string.

* **tag**: Filters by device tag.
  * Operands: is, is_not
  * Value: Name of the tag.


* **app**: Filters by the app assigned to the device.
  * Operands: is, is_not
  * Value: App name.
  * Optionally adding **app_version** to the filter will filter by the app version.
    * Operands: is, is_not
    * Value: App version.


* **device_state**: Filters by the current state of the device.
  * Operand: is
  * Possible Values: online, offline


* **deployment**: Filters by the deployment status of the device.
  * Operand: is
  * Possible Values: pending, in_progress, success, failed, aborted, any
  * Additional Property: Requires the deployment_id from the Deployments tab of the Updates page in the Connect web UI.

#### deployment_configuration

The deployment_configuration object specifies the parameters for the deployment:

* flow_uuid: (Required) Specifies which update flow to use. You can obtain the UUID from the “Update Flows” tab in the
  Connect web UI.
* comment: (Optional) You can add a brief comment to describe the purpose or importance of the deployment.
* app: (Optional) Defines the deployment tag to deploy. This includes the deployment tag name and its version (e.g., "name": "
  default_app", "version": "v1.1").
* parameters_mapping: (Optional) Specifies the update parameters configured in the update flow. Example: {"
  update_param_name1": "value", "update_param_name2": "value"}.

#### Notes

* This action is designed to trigger device updates via the JFrog Connect API.
* Ensure that you have the correct flow_uuid, project_key (fleet key in the web UI), and any necessary filters or app configurations before
  running this action.
* Filters can be left empty, but their structure must be defined.
